## App Store Notes

**Review Notes for Apple/Google:**

This app helps Capital One cardholders receive notifications about free coffee campaigns. The app:
- Does NOT directly send SMS messages
- Acts as a notification service for coffee campaigns
- Integrates with Capital One's public coffee campaign system
- Stores only phone numbers and platform preferences
- Uses Supabase for backend data storage
- Uses Expo Push Notifications for alerts

Test Credentials (if needed):
- Use any valid 10-digit phone number for testing
- Select either Android or Apple platform
- Push notifications require physical device testing

The app uses the Capital One public coffee campaign API (https://coffree.capitalone.com) which is publicly accessible and does not require authentication.
